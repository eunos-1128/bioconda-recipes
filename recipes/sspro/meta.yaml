  summary: "Predictors of protein secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility using profiles, machine learning and structural similarity"
  description: |
    SSpro and ACCpro are two distinct predictors within the SCRATCH server suite, both designed to predict protein structural features.
    While ACCpro focuses on relative solvent accessibility, SSpro predicts secondary structure.
    Both leverage machine learning and evolutionary information for their predictions.
